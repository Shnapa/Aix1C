This project currently reads data from email and sends it to either the **ChatGPT API** or the **Gemini API** for analysis. I am comparing the performance of both models to see how they handle real-world inputs and generate useful insights.

The long-term goal is to build a web application where, after entering a unit code, the AI model (whichever performs better in testing) will automatically analyze the related data and return a summary or conclusion directly in the app.

This project is part of my hands-on exploration of AI integration, prompt design, and automating real-life tasks with LLMs.

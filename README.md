A web application where, after entering a unit code, the AI model (whichever performs better in testing) will automatically analyze the related data, sent by the 1C API based on teh unit code, and return a summary or conclusion directly in the app.

This project is part of my hands-on exploration of AI integration, prompt design, and automating real-life tasks with LLMs.
